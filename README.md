# Hello-World
This is my first step in getting to understand how git works.
I am an ardent learner who studied chemical engineering in High school, as much as I love chemical engineering and would want to practice with it, The Nigerian Factor is making me think of a career swing. Now, I am starting my journey into becoming one of the greatest software engineers of all time.
More coming soon............ Stay Tuned!!!
